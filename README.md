# A Marooned Martian Marine
#### (aka Doom: The Text Adventure)

by Matt Tropiano

### Intro

A shooty romp though a demon-infested base on Mars driven by a text interface.

Requires [TAME](https://tame-if.com).

#### Compiling and/or running.

First you need TAME. Get it and build it and put it in your PATH somehow.

Then do this to run it:

	tame -s doom.tame

Or just to compile:

	tamec doom.tame

Or to turn into a standalone JS thing:

	tamec doom.tame -js browser

Or for NodeJS:

	tamec doom.tame -js node

Have fun!
